# This is a comment. # Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners. # These owners will be the default owners for everything in # the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence, # @Thrumanshow-owner1 and @HormigasAIS-owner2 will be requested for # review when someone opens a pull request. * @Thrumanshow-owner1 @HormigasAIS-owner2 # Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most # precedence.
